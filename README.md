# MSIT-Website

<p>Final project, The project was divided into two phases 
  <ol>
    <li>UI Part</li>
    <li>Backend Part</li>
   </ol>
</p>

## Phase I (UI)
We documented the various issues present in the current website and re-designed the entire UI for better 
user experience. We build the front-end part with React JS (JavaScript Library).

## Phase II (Backend)
In the phase two we are planning to identify the dynamic parts of the website like (News sections, Staff section)
to update them dynamically. So any one who update the website can update those changes without touching the 
source code.
